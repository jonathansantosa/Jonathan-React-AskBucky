Frontend:

    - Chat-History:
        - Customize current chat-history so messages appear like ChatGPT UI. (We can discuss color scheme later)
            - Allign ChatBox and ChatHistory in the same div so that they move and resize together.

    - General:
        - Adjust the css so we use VW instead of % or px while maintaining UI appearance
        - incorporate a brightness slider
            - have a black transparent screen occupy 100% vw, vh
            - increases opacity as brightness decreases.
        
    - Important:
        - Background highlighting of submit button is only done when text is inputed into the textbox. (right now it is done on hover)
        - after inputing text into the chatbox, if clicked elsewhere, the chatbox should minimize.
        - when a new message is being generated, the auto scroll should not keep scrolling to the bottom of the page
            - this prohibits the user from scrolling up while text is generated
            - the auto scrolling should stop at the start of the newly generated message
        - incorporate a "sleep" timer for when a message is recieved on the frontend. If the POST request is not acknowledged
            within reasonable time (2-3 seconds) then an "error" message should appear + the regenerate button
        - regenerate button should always appear on the last message
        - scrollbar within chatbox should only appear when chatbox (is outlined) is finished growing. 
            Appears randomly rn (associated with font-height)
        
    - Background:
        - Introduce live backgrounds similar to "live" wallpapers on iphone

Backend:

    - Chat History is a global dictionary
        - need to associate one per user
        - need to link users (accounts, preferences, chat history) to AWS

    - Pluggins:
        - Background Pluggin
            - Allows users to upload their own image or CSS style for background
            - if users upload their own image, then blur it. make necessary changes for darkmode.

    - db
        - create JSON storage for chat messages
